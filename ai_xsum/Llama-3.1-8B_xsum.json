        "That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species. The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree. This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom. This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship. Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue. \"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akro",
        "That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.

DOPA is found in the tarantula\u2019s hairs, which are then coloured brown, black or grey by melanin, the pigment found in human hair and skin. But melanin alone cannot account for the rich shades of blue and green observed in tarantulas. The team behind the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, believe that DOPA must be acting as a \u201ccolour enhancer\u201d. Tarantulas are not the only creatures to use DOPA for colour. Octopus, squid and cuttlefish also use DOPA to enhance their colours, and even some spiders use it to produce"

The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate. Penalties could include six months in prison. \"If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,\" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal. But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender. \"This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,\" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press. \"For ",

But the fight is not over: The measure would be the first of its kind in the country if it becomes law.\nTransgender activists have said the bill is discriminatory and a step backward for transgender rights. They have also said it is an unnecessary and intrusive invasion of privacy.\nThe measure is similar to a law that was approved in Texas last year. The law there bans transgender people from using the bathroom that matches their gender identity in public places, including schools and government buildings."

        "There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered. But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies. The Americans, however, had a secret plan to end the war - by using the most powerful weapon ever created. On 6 August 1945, at 8.15am Japanese time, an American B-29 bomber plane, called 'Enola Gay', dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The devastation was beyond anything seen before. The city was immediately flattened. 80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured. Even then, Japan didn't surrender. Three days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Shortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat. Wo",

Japan controlled parts of China, Korea, and much of Southeast Asia. It had taken the island of Okinawa in the spring of 1945. Okinawa is just 400 miles from Japan and it seemed that it was only a matter of time before the Japanese forces on the island were driven into the sea. If the Americans could take Okinawa, then they would have a good base for an attack on Japan itself.\nOn April 1, 1945, the Americans began to attack Okinawa. Over the next 82 days, 1,100 American ships, including 18 aircraft carriers, would take part in the battle. The Americans dropped 650,000 tons of bombs on Okinawa.

With the elegant panorama of Pembroke College behind them, the MPs wanted to find out what would be the impact of Brexit on the UK's university sector. You would be hard-pressed to find any sector in the country more opposed to Brexit than higher education. So it was probably no surprise that the MPs heard an unrelenting message that leaving the EU was a grim prospect for higher education and research. University organisations, which usually put much effort and ingenuity into not really being for or against anything in public, took to open campaigning for a Remain vote. Universities, bastions of liberal thinking, intensely international in their outlook and staffing, seemed culturally allergic to Brexit.

Both MRI and CT scanners can provide an image of the brain and the damage done, but are big and expensive. Patients have to come to them.

Strokes occur about 152,000 times a year in the United States, and up to 2 million brain cells die every minute after a stroke. If caught early, however, doctors can use a clot-busting drug called tPA to reduce the damage to brain tissue.\nThe traditional method for detecting the presence of stroke involves using CT scans to see if blood is flowing through the brain. This method is often too slow to save tissue, however, and it's not always accurate.

        "Scientists believe kissing helps people judge the quality of a potential mate through taste, smell and fitness. Once in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around. Women were found to value kissing more highly in long-term relationships. An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly. This suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says. Professor Robin Dunbar, from the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said courtship in humans was complex and involved a whole series of assessments before men and women decided to carry on their relationship. \"Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in.",

Dutch researchers, writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say this could help control diseases such as malaria. Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a significant problem in many parts of the world where malaria is endemic. It is thought that water-based spray insecticides and bed nets, which often contain low levels of insecticide, don't always kill the mosquitoes, allowing them to develop resistance. In this study, researchers from the Netherlands used a charged surface, originally developed for trapping airborne pollen, and applied insecticide to it. The long-lasting electrostatic charge allowed high levels of insecticide to stick fast to the netting, giving the mosquitoes a lethal overdose when they came into contact with the surface - even for just a few seconds.

Pensions expert John Ralfe said Peugeot owner PSA would not want to touch it \"with a barge pole\", saying he thought it had a deficit of about \u00a31bn. Half of the members were pensioners, Mr Ralfe told the BBC's Today programme. The proposed sale will be discussed in the Commons on Monday afternoon after the Speaker granted an urgent question on the matter to the Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, Justin Madders. Meanwhile a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that Prime Minister Theresa May was planning to meet Carlos Tavares, PSA chief executive, but a time and date for the meeting had not yet been fixed.

John talks to us about the role of the trustees and the issues they face.\nHow would you describe your role as a pensions trustee?\nI am a non-executive director and independent trustee of the Vauxhall Pension Trust. I joined the scheme in 2005 and was chairman of the trustees until 2010.\nWhat is the role of a trustee?\nThe main role of a trustee is to make sure that the benefits promised to the pensioners are delivered. Trustees are the guardians of the fund and are the ultimate decision-makers. They are responsible for the investment of the assets and the payment of benefits. They must ensure that the pension scheme is run in the best interests of the members and beneficiaries of the fund.\n"

        "New figures obtained by BBC Radio Oxford through a Freedom of Information request reveal 411 signalling problems during the 2014/15 financial year. They also show a 22% increase in faults from 2012/13, which has drawn criticism from commuters faced with rising prices. Network Rail blamed a lack of railway investment for the increase. Signalling systems can fail for a number of reasons, such as power cuts or blown fuses, which cause signals to turn black and drivers to stop their trains. A spokeswoman said the age of the equipment was the cause of the problems. \"We are replacing all of the signalling equipment along the Western route as part of our \u00c2\u00a37.5bn modernisation programme,\" she said. During the 2013/14 financial year there was 379 signal problems and in 2012/13 the number was 337. Sim Harris, the managing editor of Railnews magazine, said the signalling problems were causing \"major disruption to thousands of people\"",
