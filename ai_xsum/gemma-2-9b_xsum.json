Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure. The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research. \"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said. By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.

        "That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species. The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree. This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom. This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship. Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue. \"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.

It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.

The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans. It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine. The report states: \"When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water re",

        "President Rodrigo Duterte has said he wants to \"walk the extra mile\" to achieve peace, in a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. BBC Monitoring's Mark Wilson examines the challenges ahead. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) began its armed struggle in the late 1960s. Its aim has been to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare. The insurgency was established by academic, author and poet Jose Maria Sison. The CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), is believed to number around 4,000 fighters, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s during the martial law era. The NPA has engaged in killings, bombings and hostage-taking across the archipelago, collecting \"revolutionary taxes\" from businesses in the areas it controls. Both the CPP and NPA were designated foreign terrorist organisations by the US government in 2002. The rebels strongly oppose the US military presence ",

An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly.

Dutch researchers, writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say this could help control diseases such as malaria. Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a significant problem in many parts of the world where malaria is endemic. It is thought that water-based spray insecticides and bed nets, which often contain low levels of insecticide, don't always kill the mosquitoes, allowing them to develop resistance. In this study, researchers from the Netherlands used a charged surface, originally developed for trapping airborne pollen, and applied insecticide to it.

A direct listing would save the music service the underwriting fees needed to launch an initial public offering (IPO), and would avoid diluting the value of existing stakes in the company.

The system is aimed at tackling illiteracy and preventing rigging. In the 2011 election, only two votes were declared invalid after people placed their marbles on top of drums. Observers say Mr Barrow",
        "Officials have also banned demonstrations to prevent unrest after the elections. Estate agent Adama Barrow is challenging President Yahya Jammeh, who says divine intervention will give him a fifth term.\nMr Barrow says the election is a chance for Gambians to move on from decades of oppression under Mr Jammeh. The president, who has ruled for 22 years, has been accused of killing political opponents and critics.\nHe has denied the allegations.\nThe election is due to be held on 1 December.\nMr Barrow, 51, was selected by a coalition of seven opposition parties to run for the presidency.\nThe main opposition party, the United Democratic Party, had been boycotting the polls because it said the electoral system was not fair.\nMr Barrow said he would make sure the polls were free and fair.\n\u201cThe Gambia is a democratic country and we have to respect the constitution,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cGambians should go out and vote.

        "As the form of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side hit a new nadir with a 3-1 defeat by Liverpool, social media took great delight in pointing out the irony of the Blues boss being pictured with a sign reading \"I'm a Chelsea fan, I'm in trouble\".\n\nThe picture, taken before kick-off, was posted by the club's official Twitter account and promptly mocked by fans of the Reds and other teams.\n\nThe sign is a reference to a popular Chelsea chant, with supporters singing \"I'm a Chelsea fan, I'm in trouble\" to the tune of the song 'I'm a Believer' by The Monkees.\n\nThe phrase was coined by a Chelsea fan who was so concerned about his team's chances against Liverpool that he bought a ticket for the away end.\n\nChelsea were beaten 1-0 at Anfield in April 2007 and were also beaten in the FA Cup final at the same"

        "But he warns that the number of children doping to reach the elite level is Wada's \"biggest concern\". Howman said sport's increasing profitability had led to young athletes becoming more \"vulnerable\". Drug testing is limited in non-elite events, and Howman admits teenagers are \"under the radar\" of doping agencies. He also said doping could become a criminal offence in five years. Howman said Wada's estimation of the level of cheating varied between sports. \"We have some guestimates based on some research undertaken over the last years,\" he told BBC's Hardtalk. \"It's far more than we would wish it to be - over 10%. That is of concern because those being caught by the system is far lower than that. Not in all sports, in some sports. Media playback is not supported on this device \"The area of most concern",

We're going to start testing them.\"\n\nHowman, who is in Sydney to attend the World Anti-Doping Conference, said a Wada investigation into children using performance-enhancing drugs was the first step towards establishing the problem.\n\n\"This is a new area and it's the first time anyone has tried to do it,\" he said. \"It's a big issue for Wada and it's the biggest concern.

        "Davide Nicola made the deal in April, when Crotone looked certain to go down. But they won six of their final nine matches of the season to avoid the drop by two points, after having won just three games from their previous 29. The 44-year-old arrived in his home town of Vigone near Turin on Sunday - nine days after leaving Crotone. \"Am I tired? I still do not feel any particular pain,\" he said. \"It's been a beautiful journey, a fairytale. From tomorrow maybe I will feel a bit tired, but what matters most to me is that my goal has been achieved.\" Three years ago, Nicola's 14-year-old son Alessandro was killed after being knocked off his bike by a bus in Vigone. \"I kept the promise and, with the help of many people, we have also attracted the attention of many people to the question of safety on the roads,\" he added. \"Here in Turin I was greeted with great enthusiasm, I am very excited.\" Nicola ma",

        "The doping review board of the IAAF - athletics' governing body - agreed the seven athletes had met \"exceptional eligibility criteria\". The group includes world champions Sergey Shubenkov and Mariya Kuchina. In November 2015, Russia was banned from international athletics after claims of state-sponsored doping. The country did not compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, after which the suspension was extended. As it stands, Russia will not have a team at this year's World Championships, which take place in London during August. But Shubenkov and Kuchina could now defend their respective 110m hurdles and high jump titles. Athletes can apply to the IAAF doping review board for neutral status if they can demonstrate they meet drug-testing criteria. The other five to be cleared are pole vaulters Illia Mudrov and Olga Mullina, race walkers Sergey Shirobokov and Yana Smerdova, and high jumper Daniil Tsyplakov. They",

The group includes world champion 400m hurdler Kerron Clement, who missed the Beijing Olympics last year because of a doping ban.\n\n\"The athletes had previously been suspended under the IAAF anti-doping rules and have been banned from competition and ineligible to represent their country since the date of their last positive test,\" the IAAF said in a statement.\n\nThe athletes - who include US long jumper Dwight Phillips and Jamaican sprinter Sherone Simpson - were suspended in 2008 after a lab in Cologne, Germany, had its accreditation withdrawn. The Cologne lab had been used by the IAAF for testing but the governing body did not inform athletes that their samples had been stored there.\n\nIn a separate ruling, the board also decided that 17 athletes could continue to compete."
