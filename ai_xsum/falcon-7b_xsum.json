This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom. This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship. Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue. \"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Sci",

Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks. The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild. Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika. After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds.",

Conservationists say that human activity has led to the decline of the bird, which is a species of great economic importance for the region.\nThe researchers, who recently released a book and documentary about the species, say the bird\u2019s decline is likely due to human activity. They say that many of the chicks are killed by dogs, cats, and other predators, but also by the local people.\n\u201cThey are not very smart birds, so they fly down to the ground and they get caught in fishing nets, and they get eaten by dogs and cats and other predators,\u201d said Dr. Chris Elphick, an ornithologist at the University of Queensland.\nThe bird is known for its beautiful plumage, and it is an important part of the local economy.

An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly. This suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says.

Dutch researchers, writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say this could help control diseases such as malaria. Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a significant problem in many parts of the world where malaria is endemic. It is thought that water-based spray insecticides and bed nets, which often contain low levels of insecticide, don't always kill the mosquitoes, allowing them to develop resistance. In this study, researchers from the Netherlands used a charged surface, originally developed for trapping airborne pollen, and applied insecticide to it. The long-lasting electrostatic charge allowed high levels of insecticide to stick fast to the netting, giving the mosquitoes a lethal overdose when they came into contact with the surface - even for just a few sec",

Labiaplasty is the most common type of female genital cosmetic surgery, in which the size of the labia minora is reduced.

Mr Turnbull, a supporter of marriage equality, backed his party's calls to allow a national vote on the issue. But the stance has angered some who fear a vote would be divisive. Currently, same-sex couples can have civil unions or registered relationships in most Australian states but they are not considered married under national law. Cat Rose, who put forward the motion at the Mardi Gras parade's annual general meeting, accused Mr Turnbull of using last year's event as a \"media opportunity\".

Experts say there are many reasons for this. Vital ones to change are low awareness of symptoms and screening. According to Cancer Research UK, black women are less likely than white women to go for a mammogram when invited by the NHS. Spotting cancer early is important because the sooner it can be treated, the better the outcome. A support group in Leeds helps women of black African and Caribbean descent who have either had breast cancer themselves or have loved ones who have. One woman there told the BBC: \"A lot of us black people bury our head in the sand.

Although this species was widespread at the time, scientists have largely had to rely on incomplete fossils. The analysis was carried out at the ESRF facility in Grenoble, France, and showed that the specimen was juvenile. The skeleton is too small and fragile, and the rocks around it too hard, to allow it to be studied by conventional means. In addition, the rock matrix in which the fossil is preserved contains trapped minerals which prevented it from being scanned in a standard CT scanner. The specimen was discovered in a stream bed on a farm in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa by palaeontologist Billy de Klerk. \"There's still a lot we don't know about early plant-eating dinosaurs,\" said Prof Jonah Choiniere from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johanne",
